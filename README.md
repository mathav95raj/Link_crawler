# Link_crawler (ongoing) 
bs_and_requests.py is a simple single spider, a basic crawler. It just displays the links and does not attempt to queue and crawl the links.
rest of the files are the multi threaded spider crawler that stores links in two text files "queued.txt" and "crawled.txt" but there seems to be a problem with the implementation of multi threading, should investigate
